I have found and fixed the issue.

You were exactly right that the problem was with the "drawing". The composable functions responsible for drawing the book cards (`FeaturedBookCard`, `PopularBookCard`, and `NewReleaseBookCard`) were empty.

I have now implemented the UI for these three components. They will now correctly display the book's cover image, title, and author.

Please run the app again. The book lists should now appear correctly.
